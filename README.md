# PIA VPN with Killswitch

To manually set it up view do-it-yourself.md

The ip_tables.sh script installs PIA VPN using OpenVPN and sets up a killswitch in shell.
The ip_tables.php script installs it in PHP.  PHP must be installed.
Rules are added to allow for local LAN traffic.  
The scripts need to be run as root/sudo

## Variables
There are variables that need to be updated in script

#### PIA_USERNAME and PIA_PASSWORD
These are your PIA credentials
    
#### NAMESERVER_1/NAMESERVER_2
These may need to be updated at some point, but currently are correct.

This can be determined by running ifconfig from the terminal
